# **News Summarization with Seq2Seq Model**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based **Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Model** for automated text summarization. The model generates concise and accurate summaries of news articles, making it easier to consume large volumes of information effectively. The Seq2Seq architecture is commonly used in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and text summarization.

## **Dataset Description**
The project utilizes the **News Summary Dataset** from Kaggle, which contains:
- **Articles:** The main body of text from various news sources.
- **Summaries:** Human-written concise summaries corresponding to the articles.

The dataset is preprocessed to remove noise, tokenize text, and prepare it for training the Seq2Seq model.

## **Methodology**

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- Removed unnecessary characters and noise from text.
- Tokenized text into meaningful units.
- Applied padding for uniform sequence lengths.

### 2. **Model Architecture**
- Implemented a **Seq2Seq model** consisting of:
  - **Encoder:** Processes input sequences.
  - **Decoder:** Generates summaries.
- Integrated an **attention mechanism** to focus on relevant parts of the input text during summarization.

### 3. **Training**
- Optimized the model with **hyperparameter tuning**.
- Applied **regularization techniques** to prevent overfitting.

### 4. **Evaluation**
- Measured the quality of generated summaries using **BLEU scores**.
- Compared model outputs with human-written summaries to evaluate relevance and clarity.

## **Key Achievements**
- Built a functional Seq2Seq model with attention for text summarization.
- Improved clarity and relevance of generated summaries through hyperparameter tuning.
- Enhanced preprocessing pipeline for efficient model training.
